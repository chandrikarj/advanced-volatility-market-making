## 🎯 Strategy Components

### 1. Volatility Adaptation
- Calculates real-time market volatility using rolling standard deviation
- Automatically adjusts spreads from 0.1% (stable) to 1% (high volatility)
- Provides risk protection during market stress events

### 2. Trend Analysis
- Moving average crossover system (5-period vs 14-period)
- Threshold-based signals (>0.3%) prevent false positives
- Maintains market neutrality while capturing momentum

### 3. Inventory Management
- Target 50/50 base/quote allocation
- Asymmetric spreads for systematic rebalancing
- Dynamic order sizing (20% increase when rebalancing needed)
- Maximum 30% skew tolerance

## 🛡️ Risk Management

- **Market Risk**: Spread caps (1% max, 0.1% min), volatility-based sizing
- **Inventory Risk**: Real-time monitoring, asymmetric spreads, deviation limits
- **Operational Risk**: Error handling, order refresh, state management
